## Task 3 Contact Management Application
  1. Add Contact
  2. View All Contacts
  3. Search Contact
  4. Update and Remove Contact
  5. Export and Import Contact Information
  
## Details
  Used TreeMap to Store Contact Information, FasterXML/jackson to Store and Load information from external text file.
  
## Hardels:
  As Jackson converts the elements as LinkedHashMap, I had to write code to convert it to Expected POJO.
